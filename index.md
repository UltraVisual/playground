This section of my github pages are just a place for me to dump my general messing abouts, experiments and sometime attempts at doing something cool (ish). I write in ES6 generally so somethngs may not work in older browsers and I am not making any attempt to support them - so if you are having problems viewing anything - check it in chrome.
